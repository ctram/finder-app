== README
This is a basic app built to explore Angular's functionality.

Core features:
- Integration with Google maps for displaying location of search results.
- Integration with Yelp for business search results.
- Repositioning of map based on location of search results.
- User is given the option to restrict search within the current viewport of the map, e.g. a restricted search will only return results nearby where the user is currently on the map. Unrestrict search leaves it up to Yelp to determine the most relevant location given the search terms (i.e. a search for just "Chicago" will likely return businesses in Chicago). The app will reposition the map accordingly.

Tools used:
- Angular.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
